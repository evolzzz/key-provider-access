# CPA Key Provider Access

`key-provider-access` is a local CLIProxyAPI plugin derived from the layout and management UI of `key-model-access` v0.1.3. It keeps CPA's built-in downstream API-key authentication and applies a per-key allow/deny policy to upstream credential profiles instead of model names.

Profiles include both OAuth credentials and API-key-backed providers. Policies store CPA's stable auth IDs, never OAuth tokens or upstream API keys.

## Behavior

- CPA authenticates a downstream key and supplies `Metadata.caller_scope`.
- A key without a policy may use every eligible upstream profile.
- `deny_profiles` wins over `allow_profiles`.
- A non-empty `allow_profiles` list is a whitelist.
- An empty `allow_profiles` list allows every profile not matched by `deny_profiles`.
- `*` matches any number of characters and `?` matches one character.
- The scheduler chooses only among allowed candidates and round-robins eligible candidates.
- If CPA rotates every current profile ID and an allow list therefore has no direct match, the
  scheduler transiently adopts the current non-denied candidate tier so requests continue. The
  dashboard's catalog reconciliation then adds those IDs to the policy when the operator saves;
  deny rules still win and this fallback never adopts a denied profile.
- Legacy Gemini, Gemini Interactions, Claude, Codex, and xAI API-key profile IDs from CPA's
  pre-v7.2.146 format are matched against current candidates using transient attributes. This
  preserves existing allow/deny rules across CPA's ID-format change without persisting credentials
  or silently allowing a different key.
- The after-auth interceptor verifies the selected auth ID before an upstream executor receives the request.
- Missing identity, missing selected-auth metadata, or invalid policy state fails closed whenever policies exist.

The scheduler opts into CPA's cross-priority candidate mode. It applies the per-key allow/deny policy first, then keeps only the highest priority tier that remains allowed and round-robins inside that tier. This preserves CPA priority semantics while allowing a key to use a lower-priority profile when all higher-priority profiles are denied for that key. CPA Home mode currently bypasses plugin schedulers; the after-auth check still prevents a disallowed profile from being used, but it cannot reroute that request.

Only one scheduler plugin is active in CPA (the highest-priority enabled scheduler). Configure plugin priorities deliberately if another scheduler plugin is enabled.

## Configuration

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled: true
  dir: "plugins"
  configs:
    key-provider-access:
      enabled: true
      priority: 100
      version: 2
      policies: []
```

The Web UI is available at:

```text
/v0/resource/plugins/key-provider-access/settings
```

It reuses the same-origin CPAMC management session, reads downstream CPA keys to derive caller scopes, and builds a profile catalog from CPA's read-only auth/config management endpoints. Provider secrets are used only transiently to reproduce CPA's stable auth IDs and are not written to plugin state, DOM, browser storage, or URLs.

The panel identifies each downstream key with a masked head-and-tail display; the middle of the full key remains hidden. Full downstream keys are not persisted.

Allow and deny profile choices are visually dimmed when they overlap, but remain clickable: choosing one removes the conflicting rule from the opposite side. Clicking an individual profile while `*` is active expands the wildcard into explicit current profiles with that profile excluded.

On first use, the UI creates `plugins/key-provider-access/config.toml` and patches only this plugin's `policy_file` setting. Policy updates use revision ETags and atomic file replacement.

## Policy schema

```toml
version = 2

[[policies]]
caller_scope = "f7291f3315e5ab0d3c02015a081879d748693f231d8370b43f38f57be991734a"
allow_profiles = ["codex:apikey:abc123def456", "oauth-profile-id"]
deny_profiles = ["*-retired"]
```

Use the Web UI to derive caller scopes and choose current profile IDs. Do not put raw downstream keys, OAuth material, or provider API keys in policy files.

## Build and test

```bash
make check
make build
```

The Linux amd64 output is `dist/key-provider-access.so`. Install it as `plugins/linux/amd64/key-provider-access-v0.1.0.so` (or the unsuffixed name) and enable the matching `key-provider-access` config entry.

## Management API

- `GET /v0/management/plugins/key-provider-access/status`
- `GET/PUT /v0/management/plugins/key-provider-access/policies`
- `POST /v0/management/plugins/key-provider-access/reload`
- `POST /v0/management/plugins/key-provider-access/initialize-storage`

All routes use CPA management authentication. Status output never includes caller scopes or credentials.
